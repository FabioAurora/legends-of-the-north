# rock-paper-scissors

In our UI, the player should be able to play the game by clicking on buttons rather than typing their answer in a prompt.

1- For now, remove the logic that plays exactly five rounds.

2- Create three buttons, one for each selection. Add an event listener to the buttons that call your playRound function with the correct playerSelection every time a button is clicked. (you can keep the console.logs for this step)

3- Add a div for displaying results and change all of your console.logs into DOM methods.

4- Display the running score, and announce a winner of the game once one player reaches 5 points.

5- You will likely have to refactor (rework/rewrite) your original code to make it work for this. That’s OK! Reworking old code is an important part of a programmer’s life.
